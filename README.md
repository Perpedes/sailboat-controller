#Sailing Robot for Ocean Monitoring

###Mechatronics Design and Build (2013) - University of Southern Denmark


#####Background
Autonomous Sailing Vehicles (ASV) have been gaining more and more attention these years due to decreasing fossil fuel resources, environmental pollution, climate change, economics crisis, etc. There are numerous potential applications for ASVs, because of the large water area on earth, as well as the widely available energy resource that is wind. Climate date collection, oceanographic plotting, safety surveillance are obvious examples of application for ASVs. But there are challenges to design and operate an ASV because of its propelling method: wind is a changeable resource and the operational environment, the ocean is harsh.

#####Objective:
The objective of the project is to make a fully-functional and robust ASV to incorporate the expertise and knowledge previously gained at the university, both in software/control theory and implementation/hardware. We start by designing a reliable electro/mechanical system and develop a mathematical control model. These solutions will then be fully implemented on a newly purchased sailboat, which will undergo a series of tests for reliability and controllability. Both the hardware and software will be improved during the process. As a final test, the functioning prototype should be able to reach a predefined distant (a few kms) destination totally autonomously.

#####Tasks
1. Sailing/rudder actuation system design
2. Mathematical modeling/Control algorithm development
  * Energy saving control loop.
  * Continuous sailing.
3. Embedded controller system
  * The MCU need to be interchangeable, which means the interface has to be modular.
  * Select the electronics sensors and communication system protocol
4. Energy system design
  * Long-lasting battery life
5. System integration and building
  * Robust and controllable
  * Friendly user interface

#####Skills/knowledge
1. Mechanical design and build
2. Mathematical modeling and control system design
3. Embedded system development and implementation

#####Goal
1. **Hardware functional system**: Mechanical system, actuator system, energy system,
electronics sensor/controlling system
2. **Robust of the design is evaluated at each stage**: waterproof test, communication test, self-sustainable energy system test, autonomous sailing algorithm test!
3. **Autonomous algorithm implementation**
